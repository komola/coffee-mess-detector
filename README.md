# What is this for?

This project was inspired by the automatic code quality check tools in the ruby world, especially (Flog)[https://github.com/seattlerb/flog].

We are taking a pretty similar approach and give scores for your code.

Right now we have a very limited feature set, but we are working hard on extending the functionality so that this can be used in a CI server for automatic code quality control.

# Warning! This is under HEAVY development

This project is at a very EARLY stage. However, if you want to jump in and help us out, you are more than welcome to do so. To get started clone this repository, do a `npm install`.

Now you can run `npm test` and you should see green checkmarks! :)

coffee-mess-detector is a test-driven project, so every functionality that currently exists should have a test case for it.

You can take a look in the test folder to see which functionality is currently supported.
